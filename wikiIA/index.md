# WIKI IA 

This wiki aims to facilitate contact between members of IHCantabria who have experience or need to apply artificial intelligence techniques.  

The best knowledge transfer we can have is the collaboration between colleagues. For this reason, we suggest that you find a time to meet and talk face-to-face. So, this wiki is here to find easily the contents and contacts you need.

In each section you will find a list of developments, projects, explorations made by a member of IHCantabria, with a link to a small descriptive file of the same with a TL;DR aim (Too Long = Don't Read, we want you to talk face-to-face)
